## 1. About

This extension is, to some extent, a PHP wrapper for the Boost.Asio library, hence the name php-asio.

It provides a high-performance event-driven model for networking, which makes asynchronous and concurrency simple.

Now php-asio is **in development**, do not use it in production.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

## 2. Build

### 2.1 Requirements

* 64-bit PHP 7
* [PHP-CPP](http://www.php-cpp.com/) \(GitHub master branch\)
* The [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) C++ libraries
* C++ compiler which fully supports C++11 \(g++ 4.8.5 and above, clang 3.3 and above\)

### 2.2 Notes

* PHP-CPP and this extension **MUST** be built with the same version of PHP source code.
* Do not use the 2.0.0 release of PHP-CPP. Use the GitHub master branch instead. See [here](https://cismon.net/2017/09/19/PHP-CPP-bug-which-causes-memory-leak/) for details.
* It is strongly recommended that you use the latest stable version of libboost. I once used version 1.55, but it does not work well with PHP, sometimes you may get some absurd segfaults which are not fixable. Version 1.63 works fine.

## 3. Documentation

Signatures of classes and functions can be found within [stubs/](stubs/) directory, with PHPDoc.

There are also some examples in the [examples/](examples/) directory.

A detailed documentation will be coming soon once the first stable version is released.
